1️⃣ Project Overview

The Simple Calculator is a console-based Python application developed as part of **CSFCP Assignment 4**.  
It performs four mathematical operations:  
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  

The project demonstrates:
- Python programming basics
- Use of Visual Studio Code for development
- Applying Git version control
- Hosting code on GitHub with documentation

The main purpose is to understand a real-world software workflow in a simple project.

## 🛠 2️⃣ Development Process (How It Was Built)

### Step-by-step work done:
1. Created a new folder and opened it in VS Code
2. Initialized Git repository using: git init
3. Wrote menu UI → committed changes
4. Added addition & subtraction features → committed changes
5. Added multiplication & division → committed changes
6. Added error handling & code improvements → committed changes
7. Connected project with GitHub:git remote add origin <repo-link>
git push -u origin main
8. Added screenshots in README.md to repo
9. added .gitignore To exclude unnecessary files/folders 

### Tools Used
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Python | Building calculator logic |
| VS Code | Writing + Testing code |
| Git | Version control |
| GitHub | Project hosting & collaboration |

## 🚀 3️⃣ Future Improvements

To improve usability and functionality, the following features can be added:

- GUI (Graphical User Interface) using Tkinter
- More operations: modulus, exponent, square root
- Continuous mode using loops (perform next operation without restart)
- Better user input validation using exception handling
- Convert app into a desktop application (.exe)
